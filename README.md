# Graph-Based-Intrusion-Detection-for-CAN-Bus-Security-An-Explainable-AI-Approach

This research framework includes:
1. Graph construction from the dataset
2. Feature extraction using metrics such as "Page Rank," "Closeness Centrality," "Betweenness Centrality," "In-Degree Centrality," and "Out-Degree Centrality"
3. Model development and evaluation through comprehensive metrics
4. Explainable AI (XAI) analysis of the proposed model using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
